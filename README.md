I tried to make simple tic-tac-toe like game with a twist.
Let's see if AI can gasp the nuances.

Engine used:  ChatGPT 4o
Can be viewed on github pages at: https://priitpaasukene.github.io/

History of prompt:

* Iteration 1 - single html with tic-tac-toe mechanics.. I was not happy with it
* Iteration 2 - html, css, js - buggy and I understood that task was too complex
* Iteration 3 - single html with some bugs in game mechanics
* Iteration 4 - either I made error with filenames or game did not work. Computer turns were instant.
* Iteration 5 - Game mechanics are there. Some bugs are still there (eg - when computer wins, last crocodile is not displayed)
